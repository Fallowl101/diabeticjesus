<h1>Virginity Restoration Ritual</h1>
<br>
<p>
1) First, the sex-haver must pray to <a href="gods/bakhulaha.html">Bakhūlá'hā</a> 69 times. They must be careful to not pray to <a href="gods/bahulaha.html">Bahūlá'hā</a>. Summoning <a href="gods/bahulaha.html">Bahūlá'hā</a> once will cause the ritual to fail and the person to be a permanent sex-haver.
<br>
2) Then the sex-haver must retrieve a receipt of sex from the other sex-haver to supply to a accountant. The accountant will then pray to <a href="gods/bahulamuni.html">Bahūlá'müní</a> 3 times to ensure that the reciepts are in order.
<br>
3) Once it has been approved, a union worker must pray to <a href="gods/bahulaunion.html">Bahūlá'ūní'on</a> once to ensure that no workers' rights were violated during the intercourse.
<br>
4) After human rights have been protected, a lawyer must pray to <a href="gods/bahulala.html">Bahūlá'lá</a> twice to ensure that the sex-haver has legal protection from the person they had sex with.
<br>
5) The sex-haver must pray to <a href="gods/bahulavirgo.html">Bahūlá'virgö</a> to restore virginity.
<br>
6) Then the God Emperor must pray to <a href="gods/papa.html">Bahūlá'pápá'i</a> to get religious sanction for the repention of sins.
<br>
7) Finally the sex haver must say "yoyoyo <a href="gods/redacted.html">[REDACTED]</a> please forgive me yo" to end the ritual
